# eQuipt - An app for the LARPing community

## Introduction

eQuipt is an app intended to enable the LARP (live action role play) community to enjoy their roleplay without the complications that pen and paper involve. Traditionally players would have to carry around physical paper cards with their "items" written down, which could possibly be misplaced, stolen, destroyed, etc. With the digitization of this information, the player can wander about, questing and exploring in a bit more care-free manner. It also adds the ability for staff and admin users to both create items and also keep better tabs on items, such as where items exist, how many there are, and who has what within their community.

## Technologies Used
This app has been coded in Javascript, React.js is used as the frontend framework. Redux.js was used to manage state. Bcrypt.js was used for password hashing. Passport.js is implemented for user authentication. Node.js, Mongoose.js (ODM), and MongoDB are used for backend data management. Movement on page load brought to you by Sass. Light use of regular expressions (Regex) was included. Lastly, written to be mobile friendly, we have implemented Service Workers to enable an "offline" viewing of user inventory via mobile phone.
